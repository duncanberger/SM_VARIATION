## Abstract
Mass-drug administration (MDA) of human populations using praziquantel monotherapy has become the primary strategy for controlling and potentially eliminating the major neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. To understand how long-term MDA impacts schistosome populations, we analysed whole-genome sequence data of 570 *Schistosoma mansoni* samples (and the closely related outgroup species, *S. rodhaini*) from eight countries incorporating both publicly-available sequence data and new parasite material. This revealed broad-scale genetic structure across countries but with extensive transmission over hundreds of kilometres. We characterised variation across the transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel, TRPM<sub>PZQ</sub>, a target of praziquantel, which has recently been found to influence praziquantel susceptibility. Functional profiling of TRPM<sub>PZQ</sub> variants found in endemic populations identified four mutations that reduced channel sensitivity to praziquantel, indicating standing variation for resistance. Analysis of parasite infrapopulations sampled from individuals pre- and post-treatment identified instances of treatment failure, further indicative of potential praziquantel resistance. As schistosomiasis is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2030 in all currently endemic countries, and even interruption of transmission in selected African regions, we provide an in-depth genomic characterisation of endemic populations and an approach to identify emerging praziquantel resistance alleles.
