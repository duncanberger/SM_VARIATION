## Abstract
Mass-drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel monotherapy has become the primary strategy for the control and elimination of the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. To understand how long-term MDA impacts schistosome populations we analyzed whole-genome sequence data of 574 Schistosoma mansoni and S. rodhaini accessions from eight countries. We characterized variation across the transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel, Sm.TRPMPZQ, a mediator of praziquantel efficacy. Targeted mutagenesis identified four mutations in endemic populations that reduced channel sensitivity to praziquantel, indicating standing variation for resistance. Analysis of parasite infrapopulations sampled from individuals pre- and post-treatment identified instances of treatment failure, further indicative of praziquantel resistance. Finally, we identified recent, recurrent hybridization between S. mansoni and the rodent-infective S. rodhaini, with possible introgression of S. rodhaini alleles into S. mansoni populations. As schistosomiasis is targeted for elimination as a public health problem, we provide an in-depth genomic characterization of endemic populations and an approach to characterize emerging praziquantel resistance alleles.
